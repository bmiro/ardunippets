Some snippets and libs for arduino.

All those snippets are pretend to be used from the terminal WITHOUT the
Arduino IDE. They can be edited with your favourite editor and upload to
the board by issuing a simple `make upload` thanks to `arduino-mk` project.

The scritps assumes that you have a Debian derivate distro and a Arduino UNO,
if not adjust the Makefiles and commands according to your situation.
